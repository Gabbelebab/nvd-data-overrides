# NVD Data Overrides

This repository is for filling the gap NVD has left in the public vulnerability dataset.

This repo is meant to provide additional data that is currently missing from NVD. Please note, this data does not provide severity information. By definition only NVD can supply NVD CVSS scores.

The tooling that drives this repo as well as ideas for capturing the vulnerability data in a nicer way is being tracked in a repo called [vulnerability-data-tools](https://github.com/anchore/vulnerability-data-tools). Please use that repo for filing issues and collaborating. This repo only contains generated data.
